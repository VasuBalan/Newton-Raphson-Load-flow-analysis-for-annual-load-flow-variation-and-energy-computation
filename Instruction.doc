This is Newton Raphson Load For program for Various Load Level

Two Load Levels are there :
1.IEEERTS.dat	- 96 hous load profile for each seasons
2.LDData.dat	- Approximate 5 level load profile from load duration 			  curve from IEEERTS.dat


LFAnn.c is the main C file. (LFAnn - Load Flow for Annual Load Variations)

In order the get the different test system output, we have to change the data in Offline.txt file

xx - 33 or 69 bus distribution system
zz - 96 or 5 load level (96 - from IEEE paper, 5-Approximate Load level) 
Depends on the load level we have to change the hrs in main program

*********************************************
Where to change in Offline.txt file

busxx.dat			-- xx represent the bus data
1Ybus.txt
2Volt.txt			-- Intermediate steps to cross check or verify
3Jaco.txt
4Inv.txt
xxbusLLzz.out			-- xx represent the bus data and zz represents the loadlevel data
IEEERTS.dat/ LDData.dat		-- Select 96/5 (any one as load level)	
Summaryxx_zz.out		-- Which give the summary of this program.
