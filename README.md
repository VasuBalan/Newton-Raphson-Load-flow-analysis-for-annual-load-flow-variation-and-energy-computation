# Newton-Raphson-Load-flow-analysis-for-annual-load-flow-variation-and-energy-computation
This is an simple nwton raphson load for analysis for various distribution system such as 33-bus and 69-bus distribtuion system.
It computes the load flow analysis for any load level variation. In this work we consider that load variation follow (IEEE RTS) data,
then computes the annual enegy computation.

The detail description to run the program is described in Instruction.doc file.

Queries/suggestion are always welcome.
